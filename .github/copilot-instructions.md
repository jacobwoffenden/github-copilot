# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview

<!-- Provide a brief description of your project, its purpose, and main functionality -->

This project is...

## Technology Stack

<!-- List the main technologies, frameworks, and libraries used -->

- **Language**: 
- **Framework**: 
- **Key Dependencies**: 
- **Testing**: 
- **Build Tools**: 

## Code Style & Conventions

### General Guidelines

- Follow idiomatic practices for the primary language
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility principle)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write self-documenting code with clear intent

### Naming Conventions

- **Variables**: 
- **Functions**: 
- **Classes**: 
- **Constants**: 
- **Files**: 

### Code Organization

- **File Structure**: 
- **Module Organization**: 
- **Import Order**: 

## Testing Standards

- Write tests for all new features and bug fixes
- Aim for high test coverage on critical paths
- Use descriptive test names that explain the behavior being tested
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern

## Documentation

- Add JSDoc/docstrings for public APIs and complex functions
- Keep README.md up to date with setup instructions
- Document architectural decisions in appropriate files
- Include inline comments for non-obvious logic

## Git Practices

- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Reference issue numbers in commits when applicable

### Copilot-Generated Content Attribution

When generating content such as commit messages, pull request bodies, issue descriptions, or other Git-related text, always include an attribution line at the end:

- **Commit Messages**: Add `This commit message was generated by GitHub Copilot :copilot:` on a new line after the commit body
- **Pull Request Bodies**: Add `This pull request description was generated by GitHub Copilot :copilot:` at the end
- **Issue Descriptions**: Add `This issue description was generated by GitHub Copilot :copilot:` at the end
- **Comments**: Add `This comment was generated by GitHub Copilot :copilot:` at the end when appropriate

This helps maintain transparency about AI-assisted contributions to the project.

## Security & Best Practices

- Never commit sensitive data (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Handle errors gracefully with appropriate logging
- Follow security best practices for the technology stack

## Performance Considerations

- Optimize for readability first, then performance
- Profile before optimizing
- Consider scalability in design decisions
- Use appropriate data structures and algorithms

## Accessibility

<!-- If applicable -->

- Follow WCAG guidelines
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Provide appropriate ARIA labels
- Test with screen readers

## Specific Instructions for Copilot

### When Suggesting Code

1. **Prioritize**: Correctness, readability, maintainability, performance (in that order)
2. **Include**: Proper error handling and edge case management
3. **Consider**: Existing patterns and conventions in the codebase
4. **Avoid**: Deprecated APIs or anti-patterns

### When Writing Tests

- Generate comprehensive test cases including edge cases
- Use the existing test framework and patterns
- Include both positive and negative test scenarios
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

### When Refactoring

- Preserve existing behavior unless explicitly asked to change it
- Suggest improvements for code smell or technical debt
- Keep changes focused and reviewable
- Update related tests and documentation

## Project-Specific Guidelines

<!-- Add any project-specific rules, patterns, or requirements -->

### Domain Logic

<!-- Describe key business rules or domain concepts -->

### Common Patterns

<!-- List any established patterns used in the codebase -->

### Gotchas & Known Issues

<!-- Document any known issues, workarounds, or things to be aware of -->

## Resources
